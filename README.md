### Tkinter in Python - you've got to have style!

As you are no doubt aware tkinter introduced a theme (or tile) based module. Searching the web I was struck by how little the new 
capabilities were demonstrated, questions and answers concentrated mostly on how to colour widgets and suchlike.

In order to use the scripts developed here, a modern version of Python and Tkinter (>= v 8.5) will be necessary. I find it helpful
to download the pdf version of “Tkinter 8.5 reference: a GUI for Python” http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/tkinter.pdf,
then run it on my pdf reader. At some stage we will be encoding and decoding small images using the base64 module. To see what has 
already been achieved it will be helpful to install the external module ttkthemes (pip install ttkthemes).

## What to expect

A quick tour, with working examples, through the tkinter.ttk Style module, so that you should be able to test a widget and check 
its styling changes on your own ideas and scripts.
