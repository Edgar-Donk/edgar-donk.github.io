We can change the colours, width, font and relief of named elements. Instead of using property options on each widget, we will use
the Style module together with relevant component and element names. The first task is to determine our access path. 

The dependancies of the main queries to find out the element properties are as follows:-
Widget name 
--> class name (widget.winfo_class) 
--> component name (Style.layout) 
--> element name (Style.element_options) 
--> element value (Style.lookup)
Each dependancy relies on the information gained from the previous enquiry.
